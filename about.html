<h2>What this script does</h2>

<p>This script will take DNA or protein sequence and find the repeated motifs of MSP1a in the order that they occur in the string.  If searching DNA, the script translates all three reading frames to amino acids and searches for repeats.  If no match is found, it constructs the reverse complement and repeats the search in all three reading frames.  At the moment, this script won't alert you if two motifs are separated by junk sequences.  I'm working on that.</p>

<h2>Brute force and Knuth-Morris-Pratt</h2>
<p>I only learned enough about pattern matching to get this script to work.  I transposed the script from <a href='http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~lecroq/string/node8.html'>this C code</a>, and a good explanation of the algorithm is <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth-Morris-Pratt_algorithm'>found here</a>.</p>
<p>The KMP algorithm is a faster way to search a string for a pattern than using brute force. It's tricky, and while I was able to learn enough to use it in this script, I don't completely understand how it works. The effect is that when a partial match is made between a pattern and a longer string, the points of comparison aren't completly reset.<p>
</p>With brute-force, the pattern is pushed along the string one character at a time. If there's a mismatch then you start all the way at the beginning of the pattern string and move to the next character in the search string. So with this example it takes three steps to find a match with brute-force.</p>

<p>With the KMP, you can skip ahead a few spaces if there's a partial match, based on a lookup table created by comparing the pattern to itself. That's the confusing part. In the same example, it only takes two steps to find a match</p>

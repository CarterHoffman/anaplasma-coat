<h2>What this script does</h2>
<p>This script will take a string of amino acids from a MSP2 seqence and determins the order of the pseudogenes that make up the hypervariable region.  The script does this by selecting 8 letter chunks brute-force-wise (see below) from each pseudogene and compares it down the length of the entered MSP2 seqeunce.  I picked 8 for no reason, it just seemed reasonable.  If you want smaller chunks, let me know.</p>
<h2>Brute force and Knuth-Morris-Pratt</h2>
<p>I only learned enough about pattern matching to get this script to work.  I transposed the script from <a href='http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~lecroq/string/node8.html'>this C code</a>, and a good explaination of the algorithm is <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth-Morris-Pratt_algorithm'>found here</a>.</p>
<p>Say you have two sequences A and B.  The sequence of A is '123456', and B is '123987'.  If you were comparing B to A, you could take the first number from each and compare.  They match, so far so good.  Comparing the second numbers of each sequence also match, and the third as well.  The fourth numbers don't match, and you stop.  Now suppose A is a lot longer than B, say A starts with '123456...' and then goes on for 1000 more digits.  You could slide B under A as you compare them, continuing along the whole length A until you reach the end.  If you were to move B under A stepwise, one space at a time while comparing until you've travelled the length of A, then you've compared B to A by brute-force.</p>
<p>Normally, you wouldn't compare things in such a rigorous manner because it would take such a long time.  You can see that the first three numbers of both sequences match, so to avoid unessissary work you would slide B three places over and start comparing B to A at that point.  That's the basis of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, except they were able to define it in a way that a mindless computer could perform comparisons between massivly long, multiple strings of characters in a much shorter time.</p>

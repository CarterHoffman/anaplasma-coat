This is a script to match sequences of MSP1a to known strains. Strain patterns change constantly, so the list of patterns grows all the time. Since this script was written, there have been another 120 or so more sequences published (Cabezas-Cruz A et. al., PLoS ONE 8(6): e65243. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0065243). I'm working on adding those.
